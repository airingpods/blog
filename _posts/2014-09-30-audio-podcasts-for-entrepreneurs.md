Listening to startup founders is a great way for budding entrepreneurs to learn.

Continuing from our discussion on [When do people listen?](/when-do-people-listen/), interview recording podcast is an ideal content for listening, since most of the interviews have very less visual material. Even when we listen to interviews on Youtube, have you often noticed yourself not looking much into your display, but just listening ?

Thought of collecting some of the good entrepreneur interview series:

-	<img style="float: right;height:75px;margin:5px;" src="/images/twist.jpg">[This Week In Startups](http://www.airingpods.com/pods/this-week-in-startups-audio): Brought to you by Entrepreneur Jason Calacanis, interviews many startup founders. Jason himself being a serial entrepreneur and angel investor adds to the quality of the podcast. Each week he has a new guest and the show has now done more than 500 episodes and is a great resource ! 

-	<img style="float: right;height:75px;margin:5px;" src="/images/mixergy.jpg">[Mixergy](http://www.airingpods.com/pods/business-tips-for-startups-by-proven-entrepreneurs-mixergy): Learn from Proven Entrepreneurs is the tagline from the host Andrew Warner. This show too has done around 1000 episodes. In each show, Andrew interviews an Entrepreneur. One difference here from Jason's above show is that there are small business owners too in this. If you are an independent app developer who made success just enough to build a sustainable business for your family, you can be on this show !

-	<img style="float: right;height:75px;margin:5px;" src="/images/500.jpg">[500 Startups](http://www.airingpods.com/pods/500-startups-podcast): This podcast is from 500 startups accelerators. In each episode they have a talk with the companies in thier portfolio, Chats with 500 Startups founders, investors, and mentors

-	<img style="float: right;height:75px;margin:5px;" src="/images/eof.jpg">[Entrepreneur On Fire Podcast](http://www.airingpods.com/pods/entrepreneur-on-fire-john-lee-dumas-awarded-best-in-itunes): Each episode brings you an Entrepreneur who shares their journey. John Lee Dumas interviews Small Business Owner and startup founders, and takes us through the success or failure journey and the AH-HA moments as he puts it.

-	<img style="float: right;height:75px;margin:5px;" src="/images/foundation.jpg">[Foundation](http://www.airingpods.com/pods/foundation): This is the audio podcast of the startup interviews by Kevin Rose. Robert Kevin Rose is an American Internet entrepreneur who co-founded Revision3, Digg, Pownce, and Milk, as Wikipedia puts it.


[Business News](http://www.airingpods.com/cats/business-news) section has more of such channels.

[Careers](http://www.airingpods.com/cats/careers) section too has similar content.

Another way to find some more of such shows is by this search on [startups](http://www.airingpods.com/search?q=startup)

Listening to interviews in the form of Audio podcast is ideal for a daily commuter. If you happen to be interested in Entrepreneur series, you are lucky, we have a lot of such content.

I will be adding more of such channels in this blog. Encourage readers to suggest in the comments.
