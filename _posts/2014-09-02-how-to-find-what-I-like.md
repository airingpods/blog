How do I find what I like ? 

How many times have you stopped watching a movie after the first 15/30 minutes ? How many hours have you tried searching for those songs which you like ? 

We have lot of *feeds* these days - facebook, twitter, google plus, many news feeds etc. In all these feeds how much ever they attempt, we still keep getting *noise* than what we like. There is tremendous improvement in this area off late, but still long way to go.

Flipboard has a great flipping experince - wasnt it better if we had to flip less and consume more... this is inspite of Flipboard doing a great job in reducing the noise. 

This is an aspiration from a consumer, but if there is a computer scientist in you, you know how hard this problem is.

On [AiringPods]({{site.airingpodsurl}}), we know and appreciate this problem (with the guilty acceptance that we havent dont enough to solve this). 

I have 15K+ podcast channels to listen to, 50+ topics to choose from. Which of those do I like? We are just touching this problem. So far, we have only been able to *organize* the content, and make the *navigation* easy for you than *sugesting* you what you would like.

How is this content organized ?

-	*Popular chart of Channels* - There is a high co-relation among people's interests. Popular charts tend to leverage this, and bubble up the good (read popular) ones. This is the listing which you see on the home page.

-	*Topics* - All the channels are organized into topics. Each channel producer has a stong feeling that his channel belong to say technology, music or any other topic. This is a stong intent. We have category based listing in these lines. Checkout [Food](http://www.airingpods.com/cats/food), [Language](http://www.airingpods.com/cats/language-courses) etc

-	*Similar* - If you tend to like a channel, would you not like to see the similar ones ? This is available in each channel page. You get to go to the list of similar channels. See the related section of [TED](http://www.airingpods.com/pods/npr-ted-radio-hour-podcast)

-	*Discover from Episodes* - You might get a taste of a channel from one of the episode. This is why we have a recent episodes section (merged from many channels combined, ordered by time of production). Browsing through this list gives us an easy way to *sample* the channel. Jump to [Episodes](http://www.airingpods.com/episodes)

This is where we have reached so far. 

Aspiration is that we reach a position to *suggest* you what you would like. Very long way!
